# Dishcovery

Website where you can browse, create, like and comment on recipes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

First install the main repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Xpuck0/dishcovery
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Assuming you are in the project main folder run:
```
$ cd softuni-practice-server/dist
```

Then run:

```
$ node server.js
```

in order to start the server.

Now we should start the app by running:

```
npm run dev in another terminal
```

You should see in the terminal an address where the app is hosted on.
If you click on the link the browser should open the app automatically, however you can also type the address manualy in the url field of the browser.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
